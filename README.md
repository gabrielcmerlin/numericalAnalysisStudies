# Numerical Analysis Projects

The duo formed by Artur de Vlieger Lima [13671574] e Gabriel da Costa Merlin [12544420] did two projects during the Numerical Analysis discipline taught in the 1st semester of 2024 by professor Cynthia Lage Ferreira. The first one discusses Linear Systems solving methods (direct and iterative) and the different ways to find roots of a function. The second one is about the use of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to compress an image, Interpolation methods and the application of Least Squares to real brazilian COVID-19 data.
